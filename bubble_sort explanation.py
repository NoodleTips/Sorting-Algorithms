# array
x = [5,2,8,3,1]

# * 2 ************************
# Bubble sort compares each pair of adjacent elements in the array and swaps them if they are int he wrong order.
# This continues to make passes until no more swaps are needed.
# Not very efficient but is straight forward.

# first pass
[5,2,8,3,1]
# second pass
[2,5,3,1,8]
# third pass
[2,1,3,5,8]
# fourth pass
[1,2,3,5,8]

# With each pass the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position.
